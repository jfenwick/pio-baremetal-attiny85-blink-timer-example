This PCB image should give an idea of how to hookup the programmer, IC, 1K resistor and LED.

The [PCB](https://github.com/jfenwick/attiny85-blink-pcb) that can be downloaded here. Easy to program with USBTinyISP or some other clone.

Based on the code at http://karooza.net/going-bare-metal-on-the-attiny85 but using PlatformIO for the toolchain.
